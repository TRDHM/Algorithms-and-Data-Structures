Problem: Implement Dijkstra's algorithm given an input file with a specific format of Origin;Destination;Trip-Length and a user defined starting position.

This program will use several data structures, the Graph, Vertex, and Queue. 

Vertex - Defined in the program as a struct to hold all values needed for each point on the graph.

Graph - Stores the names and edges of each point. This structure also includes methods for traversing the graph and determining if a point has been marked by the program.

Queue - Used to store data such as the names of each point on the graph.


The algorithm itself will begin at the input given by the user, then traverse the graph looking for the shortest total path from each. After a node has been visited it is marked so that it won't be chosen twice. All adjacent nodes are looped through, and any that have a distance value greater than what has been travled so far is updated to the current distance. After this, the next minimum distance node is chosen and the algorithm continues.
